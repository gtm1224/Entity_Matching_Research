Worn by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won\u2019t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11\/13mm and 13\/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":11734650,"category_right":"Shoes","cluster_id_right":11408584,"brand_right":null,"title_right":" \"NIKE AIR MAX 90 MESH BG\"@pl \"Buty obuwie sportowe dla dzieci Nike. \u2713 Darmowa dostawa \u2605 Sizeer \u2605\"@pl","description_right":"\"Null\"@pl ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Worn by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won\u2019t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11\/13mm and 13\/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":2814835,"category_right":"Shoes","cluster_id_right":5035853,"brand_right":null,"title_right":" \"Nike Tiempo Genio II Leather FG - Light Crimson\/Metallic Silver\/Total Crimson\"@en \" Nike Soccer Cleats Firm Ground Crimson \"@en","description_right":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it\u2019s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner\u2019s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.\n                                \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":12394664,"category_right":"Shoes","cluster_id_right":15744541,"brand_right":null,"title_right":" \"Puma Suede Classic Eco - Rouge Equipe\/ Blanc\"@fr \" Puma chaussures football hommes rouge equipe-blanc \"@fr","description_right":"\"\n                                    Partie sup\u00e9rieure 100 % daim pour un confort optimal.La\u00e7age centr\u00e9, lacets larges pour une forme parfaite.Semelle ext\u00e9rieure antid\u00e9rapante et r\u00e9sistante au frottement, 100 % caoutchouc.Bande PUMA, logo PUMA Suede Archive et logo PUMA Cat.\n                                \"@fr ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.\n                                \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":720907,"category_right":"Shoes","cluster_id_right":15744892,"brand_right":"\"Puma\"","title_right":" \"Suede Classic\" \"Puma Suede Classic - 352634-75 | everysize.com\"","description_right":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11\/13mm and 13\/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":14255913,"category_right":"Shoes","cluster_id_right":10053724,"brand_right":null,"title_right":" \"Nike Kids Tiempo Legend VI FG - Black\/White\/Metallic Gold\"@en \" Nike Junior Boots Firm Ground Gold \"@en","description_right":"\"\n                                    Engineered by Nike, the soft, full grain natural leather upper delivers the unrivalled ball feel that's been a hallmark of Tiempo for almost two decades.

To celebrate the moment of his discovery, the Nike Mercurial Superfly features a dark green that\u2019s inspired by his original club colours and neon accents to represent his shining talent.  FITDeveloped around the idea of a racecar fit, the Superfly V features a new V16 last, which is designed to engage the major metatarsal by shaping the outsole to the natural contours of your foot. This allows the metatarsals to sit lower in the boot while the big toe is slightly raised, increasing flex across the joint and allowing you to generate maximum power when sprinting off the mark.Constructed with a Flyknit and NikeSkin upper, the Superfly features an upgraded tongue less construction, while the Flywire cables within the upper are independently able to react to how the foot is engaging with the ground for optimal lockdown. To reduce the loss of elasticity over time, the Dynamic Fit collar has a tighter knit construction to enhance your proprioception with the ground, while its internal anti-skid top cloth eliminates any foot movement within the boot.TOUCHTo enhance your touch and feel, the Superfly V features a new 3-D textured Speed Rib construction, which is knitted into the cleat\u2019s Flyknit upper to create increased friction on the ball for high-speed control.  Applied with Nike\u2019s All Conditions Control (ACC) Technology, the Superfly provides consistent levels of grip on the ball in wet and dry weather conditions.TRACTIONRedesigned to improve your acceleration, the Superfly\u2019s chassis is made from compressed Nylon, which is 40% lighter than the Carbon Fibre plate used for the Superfly IV. More responsive and shaped to the anatomical V-16 last, the soleplate features chevron shaped cleat studs for quick ground penetration, release and braking on firm natural grass surfaces.\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner\u2019s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Worn by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won\u2019t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11\/13mm and 13\/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Knitted directly into the upper on the medial and lateral sides is the Magista\u2019s Flywire cables, which run from the eyelets to the bite line for strategic lockdown, while an internal heel counter keeps the ankle stable and secure.Redesigned to link the lower leg and foot, the Dynamic Fit collar is shaped to fit the natural outline of your malleolus for a more secure and protective fit, while its tighter knit construction ensures better shape retention. TOUCH A new thermoformed Flyknit upper creates a 3-D textured upper for more friction on the ball, while ACC (All Conditions Controlled) Technology provides a consistent touch on the ball in both wet and dry conditions. The laces have been moved slightly to the medial side to create a larger surface area when striking the ball, while the tongue-less construction features added padding to ensure your touch on the ball is responsive.TRACTION   Lighter than the previous version, the Magista\u2019s soleplate sees a reduction of Pebax for its nylon chassis, which has reduced the overall weight of the plate from 85g to 62g. This reduction allows the foot to get closer to ground, meaning a better and responsive feel when changing direction.   The stud pattern utilised for the Magista had been created using Fine Element Analysis (FEA), which is a computerised method that produces data to design a soleplate ideal for rotational traction on firm ground surfaces.\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional running shoe from the inside out.\n \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Der Nike Air Max BW Midnight Navy wird bei dieser Ausf\u00fchrung stolz in Dunkelblau, Wei\u00df und Schwarz zur Schau gestellt. Sneakerfreunde werden sich \u00fcber diese Farbgebung freuen und k\u00f6nnen Luftspr\u00fcnge dank eingebauter Luftpolsterung ohne sp\u00e4tere Folgesch\u00e4den durchf\u00fchren.\nWas sich im Obermaterial wiederfinden l\u00e4sst, stellt sich als Meshstoff heraus und \u00fcberzieht au\u00dfer der Zehentasche sowie Teile der Seiten den Oberschuh in Dunkelblau. Eine dunkelblaue Trennlinie aus synthetischem Stoff umrandet den ganzen Schuh einmal. Dar\u00fcber wurde ein Schweif aus Gummi wiederholt in Dunkelblau gelegt, der einen eindrucksvollen Ausdruck pr\u00e4sentiert. An dem Hacken sieht man Air Max als Namen aus Gummi in Dunkelblau. Noch weiter in Richtung Sohle behauptet sich eine Perforierung wieder in Dunkelblau.\nDie F\u00fc\u00dfe k\u00f6nnen in weichen Meshstoff in Dunkelblau tauchen und f\u00fchlen sich, im Inneren angekommen, gleich pudelwohl. Angedeutet wird der Name \"Nike Air\" auf der Zunge erneut in Dunkelblau. Seitlich sind Schn\u00fcrsenkel\u00f6sen in Plastik eingearbeitet worden, die Halt f\u00fcr die dunkelblauen B\u00e4nder liefern. Kleine Plastikapplikationen in Dunkelblau setzen sich neben diese Halterung und peppen den oberen Teil des Schuhes Ton in Ton auf.\nIn die Zwischensohle baut Nike die viel gelobte Luftkammern-Technik (Air-Technologie) ein, die beim Auftritt f\u00fcr eine D\u00e4mpfung sorgt. Sie ist zusammen mit einem Teil der Sohle in Wei\u00df ein absoluter Hingucker und zieht die Blicke f\u00f6rmlich auf sich. Durch kleine Fenster aus Kunststoff kann in das Technik-Zentrum gesehen werden und man bekommt ein Gef\u00fchl f\u00fcr die schon seit vielen Jahren bekannte Einbauweise.

For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11\/13mm and 13\/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":15093379,"category_right":"Shoes","cluster_id_right":13809058,"brand_right":null,"title_right":" \"Nike Tiempo Legend VI SG-Pro - Czarny\/Bia\u0142y\/Metaliczny Z\u0142oty\"@pl \" Nike M\u0119skie buty pi\u0142karskie Mi\u0119kka nawierzchnia Wkr\u0119ty Czarny Bia\u0142y Metaliczny Z\u0142oty \"@pl","description_right":"\"\n                                    ROZPOCZNIJ KONIECRozpocznij ka\u017cdy atak na boisku w nowych butach pi\u0142karskich Nike Tiempo 6.

As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for 'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.Features Include:100% Suede upper for optimum comfortCentrally-positioned lacing with broad laces for a perfect fitNon-slip and abrasion-resistant outer sole made from 100% RubberPUMA formstrip PUMA Suede archive logo and PUMA Cat logo\n                                \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}
