This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod\u2019s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.\n\nThe XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement.

The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure.

If you need to extend your cable run longer than 100 feet, you should consider upgrading to a RG59 cable spool, connector, and tool kit. This allows you to cut the cable to the exact length that you need.\n\n\n\nHybrid HD Surveillance DVR\n\n\t\n\n\n\tThe DVR included with this security camera system is an SD \/ HD hybrid. This means that both traditional analog security cameras and AHD high definition security cameras can be used.\n\n\n\tHere is how it works.\n\n\n\tOriginally, CCTV cameras supported D1 resolution which is 704 x 480 pixels.\n\tThen, 960H CCTV cameras were introduced which support 960 x 480 resolution (a wider format CCTV).\n\tIn 2014, AHD cameras (analog high definition), also known as HD CCTV, was introduced which supports 720p resolution (1280 x 720).\n\tIn 2015, full HD 1080p AHD cameras will be available.\n\tAll of these CCTV video formats work using the same RG59 coax cable to run video from the camera to the DVR. However, the video encoding is different between traditional CCTV (D1 and 960H, also known as standard definition - SD) and AHD.\n\tThis iDVR-E works with both traditional CCTV and AHD cameras. Users can also mix CCTV and AHD cameras on the same recorder (hybrid).\n\tImportant! If both camera types will be used, they need to be grouped in pairs of 2 by type.\n\tFor example, you can have 2 SD cameras on channels 1 and 2, and 2 AHD cameras on channels 3 and 4.\n\tYou can also install SD cameras on all channels or HD cameras on all channels, but again, when you mix technologies, it must be done in groups of two.\n\nYou can \nlearn more about what AHD is here.\n\n\n\niOS App\n\n\n\n\nThe iOS app lets users access the live view of their security cameras from remotely over the Internet. The iOS app works on iPhone and iPad devices. The app also supports remote search and playback of recorded surveillance video footage (video that has already been recorded to the DVR hard drive).\n\n\n\n\nAndroid App\n\n\nThe Android app has all of the same great features as iOS. Users can view their security cameras live and also play back recorded video footage on the DVR's hard drive.\n\n\nMac Software\n\nThe Mac client software that is included supports remote viewing and recorded video playback.\n\n\nWindows Software\n\nThe Windows client DVR software supports remote live camera viewing and recorded video playback.\n\n\nRemote Web Browser Access\n\n\n\nIn addition to the client applications for Mac and Windows PCs, users can also access their DVR from a web browser.\n\nDemo Videos\n\nBelow is a playlist of videos that show many of the features of the DVR included with the security camera system on this page. You can select which video that you want to play by clicking on the PLAYLIST icon in the upper left of the player.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nCustom System Quotes\n\nCCTV Camera Pros can provide a custom surveillance system quote with any number of cameras SD and HD security cameras that you need. As you have probably already seen on our website, we have 2, 4, 8, and 16 camera surveillance systems in pre-made packages. However, it is not possible for us to package up every combination and quantity of all the different camera models that we carry.

It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer.

Based on feedback from cinematographers, we\u2019ve complemented the FS7 with the FS7 II. Here\u2019s all the performance of the original, and more. Surpass ordinary exposure control with our Electronic Variable ND filter. Secure your lenses with our Lever Lock type E-Mount. Work faster, with greater confidence thanks to even more refined ergonomics. And change your point of view with Sony\u2019s highly capable 18-110mm servo zoom. Welcome to the next level in handheld shooting.\nElectronic Variable ND\nHere\u2019s a fresh way to control exposure. Aperture adjustments affect your depth of field. Shutter speed adjustments affect the presentation of motion. But Sony\u2019s Electronic Variable ND maintains optimum exposure without sacrificing any other parameters. Auto ND mode achieves auto exposure with cine lenses, rangefinder glass and third-party SLR lenses. And Auto ND empowers you to park your iris at the lens \u201csweet spot,\u201d where distortions are lowest and resolution is highest.\nLever Lock type E-Mount\nA robust E-Mount with a locking collar makes for more confident lens changes. To mount, simply hold the lens steady and turn the collar instead. When the collar clicks, your lens is securely locked into place. This minimizes image shifting as you work. The Lever Lock type E-Mount also supports heavier cine and ENG lenses without additional rigging. As before, the camera accepts Sony\u2019s E-Mount lenses, along with simple third-party adaptors for PL mount cinema lenses, SLR and DSLR glass, and even classic rangefinder lenses.\nErgonomics to work faster, with more confidence\nThe ergonomics set the FS7 apart. Now they\u2019re even better. Put the viewfinder exactly where you want it with the robust multi-adjustable arm. Extend Sony\u2019s telescoping Smart Grip arm entirely without tools. Park the arm alongside the body for waist-level shooting. Then experience the Smart Grip, body shape and balance that so many cinematographers have praised.\nAnd more\nTo the 4K Super35 performance of the original PXW-FS7, the FS7 II also adds the following refinements.\n\nITU-R BT.2020 recording is directly compatible with BT.2020 distribution\nPop-up LCD monitor hood in addition to the detachable eyepiece\nImproved eyepiece hook for more secure

The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod\u2019s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.\n\nThe XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 pl plate.\n\n\n                        \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod\u2019s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.\n\nThe XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.\n\n\n                        \"@en ","price_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":4467189,"category_right":"Camera_and_Photo","cluster_id_right":481159,"brand_right":null,"title_right":" \"MANFROTTO Befree Travel Tripod - Black\"@en Black LN67508 MKBFRA4-BH | SCAN UK\"@en","description_right":"\"Manfrotto Befree Compact Lightweight Tripod for Travel Photography, 1\/4 Attachment, 34cm - 144cm Height         \"@en ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Starting with a full-frame 12.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor, the a7S II is capable of internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format. For both stills and video recording, the BIONZ X image processor also pairs with the sensor to enable expanded sensitivity to ISO 409600, continuous shooting to 5 fps, and fast intelligent autofocus with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. Further enabling working in difficult lighting conditions, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization compensates for vertical, horizontal, pitch, yaw, and roll camera movements for sharper, smoother handheld recording.\n\n\nA7SII Features:\n12MP Exmor CMOS sensor\nRAW output 14 bit\nInternal 4K recording with higher dynamic range\n5 axis stabilization\nMuch improved AF in low light conditions (169 AF points)\n\nWith sensitivity settings that can extend up to ISO 409600 (Standard ISO range: 100-102400 for stills and movies. Expandable ISO range: 50-409600 for stills, 100-409600 for movies) plus extra-wide dynamic range, the \u00ce\u00b17S II can record images in spectacular and subtle detail, from shadows to highlights, under virtually any lighting conditions. The remarkable clarity and lack of noise in stills and movies that you shoot help provide the results that you've been aiming for.\n\nExmor\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 CMOS for extra sensor perception: Capture stills and movies of richer, more natural gradation. The 35mm full-frame 12.2-megapixel image sensor achieves wide dynamic range with very low noise throughout a vast ISO 50-409600 sensitivity span. Large pixels, gapless on-chip lens structure, and other light capture advances allow use of extra-high shutter speeds for low-light shooting.\n\nThe newly refined image processing algorithm of the BIONZ X optimizes image sensor performance for superior depiction of details in stills and movies throughout all sensitivity ranges. This image processing engine achieves image quality of such fine nuance and minimal noise, particularly at the mid- to high-sensitivity setting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGeneral\n\t\t\tCamera type\n\t\t\tInterchangeable-lens digital camera\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLens mount\n\t\tE-mount\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage sensorType35 mm full frame (35.6 x 23.8 mm), Exmor CMOS sensor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumber of pixels (effective)Approx. 12.2 megapixels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumber of pixels (total)Approx. 12.4 megapixels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage sensor aspect ratio3:2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnti-dust systemCharge protection coating on optical filter and image sensor shift mechanism\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \tRecording system (still images)Recording format\n                            JPEG (DCF Ver. 2.0, Exif Ver. 2.3, MPF baseline compliant), RAW (Sony ARW 2.3 format)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage size (pixels)3:2 aspect ratio 35 mm full frame L: 4240 x 2832 (12M), M: 2768 x 1848 (5.1M), S: 2128 x 1416 (3.0M)\n                            APS-C L: 2768 x 1848 (5.1M), M: 2128 x 1416 (3.0M), S: 1376 x 920 (1.3M)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t16:9 aspect ratio 35mm full frame L: 4240 x 2384 (10M), M: 2768 x 1560 (4.3M), S: 2128 x 1200 (2.6M)\n                            APS-C L: 2768 x 1560 (4.3M), M: 2128 x 1200 (2.6M), S: 1376 x 776 (1.1M)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweep Panorama Wide: Horizontal 12416 x 1856 (23M), vertical 5536 x 2160 (12M), Standard: Horizontal 8192 x 1856 (15M), vertical 3872 x 2160 (8.4M)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage quality modesRAW, RAW & JPEG, JPEG Extra fine, JPEG Fine, JPEG Standard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRAW output14 bit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPicture Effect13 modes: Posterization (Color, B\/W), Pop Color, Retro Photo, Partial Color (R, G, B, Y), High Contrast Monochrome, Toy Camera, Soft High-key, Soft Focus, HDR Painting, Rich-tone Monochrome, Miniature, Watercolor, Illustration\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCreative StyleStandard, Vivid, Neutral, Clear, Deep, Light, Portrait, Landscape, Sunset, Night Scene, Autumn Leaves, Black & White, Sepia (Contrast -3 to +3 steps, Saturation -3 to +3 steps, Sharpness -3 to +3 steps) (Style Box 1-6 also provided)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDynamic range functionsOff, Dynamic Range Optimizer (Auto\/Level (1\u00e2\u0080\u00935)), Auto High Dynamic Range: Auto Exposure Difference, Exposure Difference Level (1.0-6.0 EV, 1.0 EV step)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tColor spacesRGB standard (with sYCC gamut) and Adobe RGB standard compatible with TRILUMINOS\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Color\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \tRecording system (movies)Recording formatXAVC S \/ AVCHD format Ver. 2.0 compliant \/ MP4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVideo compressionXAVC S: MPEG-4 AVC\/H.264AVCHD: MPEG-4 AVC\/H.264MP4: MPEG-4 AVC\/H.264\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAudio recording formatXAVC S: LPCM, 2chAVCHD: Dolby Digital (AC-3), 2ch, Dolby Digital Stereo CreatorMP4: MPEG-4 AAC-LC, 2ch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage size (pixels)NTSC XAVC S 4K: 3840 x 2160 (30p\/100Mbps, 30p\/60Mbps, 24p\/100Mbps, 24p\/60Mbps)\n                            XAVC S HD: 1920 x 1080 (60p\/50Mbps, 30p\/50Mbps, 24p\/50Mbps, 120p\/100Mbps, 120p\/60Mbps)AVCHD: 1920 x 1080 (60p\/28Mbps\/PS, 60i\/24Mbps\/FX, 60i\/17Mbps\/FH, 24p\/24Mbps\/FX, 24p\/17Mbps\/FH)MP4: 1920 x 1080 (60p\/28Mbps, 30p\/16Mbps), 1280 x 720 (30p\/6Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPAL XAVC S 4K: 3840 x 2160 (25p\/100Mbps, 25p\/60Mbps)XAVC S HD: 1920 x 1080 (50p\/50Mbps, 25p\/50Mbps, 100p\/100Mbps, 100p\/60Mbps)AVCHD: 1920 x 1080 (50p\/28Mbps\/PS, 50i\/24Mbps\/FX, 50i\/17Mbps\/FH, 25p\/24Mbps\/FX, 25p\/17Mbps\/FH)MP4: 1920 x 1080 (50p\/28Mbps, 25p\/16Mbps), 1280 x 720 (25p\/6Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh Frame Rate RecordingNTSC 1920 x 1080 (24p\/12Mbps, 30p\/16Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPAL 1920 x 1080 (25p\/16Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Picture Profile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Yes (Off \/ PP1-PP9) Parameters: Black level, Gamma (Movie, Still, Cine1-4, ITU709, ITU709 800%, S-Log2, S-Log3), Black Gamma, Knee, Color Mode (Movie, Still, Cinema, Pro, ITU709 Matrix, White&Black, S-Gamut, S-Gamut3.Cine, S-Gamut3), Saturation, Color Phase, Color Depth, Detail, Copy, Reset\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMovie functionsAudio Level Display, Audio Rec Level, Auto Slow Shutter, HDMI info.

The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure. Compatible with Canon's EOS 5D Mark ii, EOS 1D Mark iV, EOS 7D, EOS 60D, EOS 600D\/Rebel T3i\/Kiss x5, EOS 550D\/Rebel T2i\/Kiss x4 and EOS 500D\/Rebel T1i\/Kiss x3.

Logitech partnered with Skype\u2122 to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*\n\nH.264 AVC compression\nGet high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates\n\nFull HD 1080p recording\nRecord videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.\n\nHD 720p video call quality\nIf Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.\n\nSharp, rich-color images\nSmooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal\u2122 technology.\n\nAuto focus\nC920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.\n\nCarl Zeiss optics\nTo bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar\u00ae design into a five-element design.

Both the sensor and processor work together to produce well-detailed, clear imagery that exhibits natural tonality and color gradations with minimal noise when working in difficult lighting conditions. The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording. The 3.0-inch Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari-angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti-reflective, smudge-resistant coating allows for clear well-detailed viewing. In addition, the camera is compatible with Canon STM lenses for smooth, quiet AF performance.\"@en-US ","price_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null}

Based on feedback from cinematographers, we\u2019ve complemented the FS7 with the FS7 II. Here\u2019s all the performance of the original, and more. Surpass ordinary exposure control with our Electronic Variable ND filter. Secure your lenses with our Lever Lock type E-Mount. Work faster, with greater confidence thanks to even more refined ergonomics. And change your point of view with Sony\u2019s highly capable 18-110mm servo zoom. Welcome to the next level in handheld shooting.\nElectronic Variable ND\nHere\u2019s a fresh way to control exposure. Aperture adjustments affect your depth of field. Shutter speed adjustments affect the presentation of motion. But Sony\u2019s Electronic Variable ND maintains optimum exposure without sacrificing any other parameters. Auto ND mode achieves auto exposure with cine lenses, rangefinder glass and third-party SLR lenses. And Auto ND empowers you to park your iris at the lens \u201csweet spot,\u201d where distortions are lowest and resolution is highest.\nLever Lock type E-Mount\nA robust E-Mount with a locking collar makes for more confident lens changes. To mount, simply hold the lens steady and turn the collar instead. When the collar clicks, your lens is securely locked into place. This minimizes image shifting as you work. The Lever Lock type E-Mount also supports heavier cine and ENG lenses without additional rigging. As before, the camera accepts Sony\u2019s E-Mount lenses, along with simple third-party adaptors for PL mount cinema lenses, SLR and DSLR glass, and even classic rangefinder lenses.\nErgonomics to work faster, with more confidence\nThe ergonomics set the FS7 apart. Now they\u2019re even better. Put the viewfinder exactly where you want it with the robust multi-adjustable arm. Extend Sony\u2019s telescoping Smart Grip arm entirely without tools. Park the arm alongside the body for waist-level shooting. Then experience the Smart Grip, body shape and balance that so many cinematographers have praised.\nAnd more\nTo the 4K Super35 performance of the original PXW-FS7, the FS7 II also adds the following refinements.\n\nITU-R BT.2020 recording is directly compatible with BT.2020 distribution\nPop-up LCD monitor hood in addition to the detachable eyepiece\nImproved eyepiece hook for more secure

The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.

You can prioritise a subject\u2019s face by touching it on the LCD. And with Smile Shutter, the FDR-AX33 can also automatically capture still shots of great (but fleeting) smiles, even while recording movies.\n\n\n\n\nLock-on AF\nEnhances the tracking of moving subjects by using the optimal AF point at all times, and adjusting the target frame size to match your subject\u2019s characteristics. Thanks to advances in phase-detection AF, it\u2019s now more accurate than ever \u2014 so lock on and shoot fast-moving targets with precision.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5.1ch microphone6\nRecord clear sound that accurately captures the atmosphere of the scene, and enjoy surround sound playback on your home theatre system.

This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod\u2019s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.\n\nThe XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement.

This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod\u2019s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.\n\nThe XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.

Starting with a full-frame 12.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor, the a7S II is capable of internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format. For both stills and video recording, the BIONZ X image processor also pairs with the sensor to enable expanded sensitivity to ISO 409600, continuous shooting to 5 fps, and fast intelligent autofocus with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. Further enabling working in difficult lighting conditions, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization compensates for vertical, horizontal, pitch, yaw, and roll camera movements for sharper, smoother handheld recording.\n\n\nA7SII Features:\n12MP Exmor CMOS sensor\nRAW output 14 bit\nInternal 4K recording with higher dynamic range\n5 axis stabilization\nMuch improved AF in low light conditions (169 AF points)\n\nWith sensitivity settings that can extend up to ISO 409600 (Standard ISO range: 100-102400 for stills and movies. Expandable ISO range: 50-409600 for stills, 100-409600 for movies) plus extra-wide dynamic range, the \u00ce\u00b17S II can record images in spectacular and subtle detail, from shadows to highlights, under virtually any lighting conditions. The remarkable clarity and lack of noise in stills and movies that you shoot help provide the results that you've been aiming for.\n\nExmor\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 CMOS for extra sensor perception: Capture stills and movies of richer, more natural gradation. The 35mm full-frame 12.2-megapixel image sensor achieves wide dynamic range with very low noise throughout a vast ISO 50-409600 sensitivity span. Large pixels, gapless on-chip lens structure, and other light capture advances allow use of extra-high shutter speeds for low-light shooting.\n\nThe newly refined image processing algorithm of the BIONZ X optimizes image sensor performance for superior depiction of details in stills and movies throughout all sensitivity ranges. This image processing engine achieves image quality of such fine nuance and minimal noise, particularly at the mid- to high-sensitivity setting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGeneral\n\t\t\tCamera type\n\t\t\tInterchangeable-lens digital camera\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLens mount\n\t\tE-mount\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage sensorType35 mm full frame (35.6 x 23.8 mm), Exmor CMOS sensor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumber of pixels (effective)Approx. 12.2 megapixels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumber of pixels (total)Approx. 12.4 megapixels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage sensor aspect ratio3:2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnti-dust systemCharge protection coating on optical filter and image sensor shift mechanism\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \tRecording system (still images)Recording format\n                            JPEG (DCF Ver. 2.0, Exif Ver. 2.3, MPF baseline compliant), RAW (Sony ARW 2.3 format)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage size (pixels)3:2 aspect ratio 35 mm full frame L: 4240 x 2832 (12M), M: 2768 x 1848 (5.1M), S: 2128 x 1416 (3.0M)\n                            APS-C L: 2768 x 1848 (5.1M), M: 2128 x 1416 (3.0M), S: 1376 x 920 (1.3M)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t16:9 aspect ratio 35mm full frame L: 4240 x 2384 (10M), M: 2768 x 1560 (4.3M), S: 2128 x 1200 (2.6M)\n                            APS-C L: 2768 x 1560 (4.3M), M: 2128 x 1200 (2.6M), S: 1376 x 776 (1.1M)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweep Panorama Wide: Horizontal 12416 x 1856 (23M), vertical 5536 x 2160 (12M), Standard: Horizontal 8192 x 1856 (15M), vertical 3872 x 2160 (8.4M)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage quality modesRAW, RAW & JPEG, JPEG Extra fine, JPEG Fine, JPEG Standard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRAW output14 bit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPicture Effect13 modes: Posterization (Color, B\/W), Pop Color, Retro Photo, Partial Color (R, G, B, Y), High Contrast Monochrome, Toy Camera, Soft High-key, Soft Focus, HDR Painting, Rich-tone Monochrome, Miniature, Watercolor, Illustration\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCreative StyleStandard, Vivid, Neutral, Clear, Deep, Light, Portrait, Landscape, Sunset, Night Scene, Autumn Leaves, Black & White, Sepia (Contrast -3 to +3 steps, Saturation -3 to +3 steps, Sharpness -3 to +3 steps) (Style Box 1-6 also provided)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDynamic range functionsOff, Dynamic Range Optimizer (Auto\/Level (1\u00e2\u0080\u00935)), Auto High Dynamic Range: Auto Exposure Difference, Exposure Difference Level (1.0-6.0 EV, 1.0 EV step)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tColor spacesRGB standard (with sYCC gamut) and Adobe RGB standard compatible with TRILUMINOS\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Color\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \tRecording system (movies)Recording formatXAVC S \/ AVCHD format Ver. 2.0 compliant \/ MP4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVideo compressionXAVC S: MPEG-4 AVC\/H.264AVCHD: MPEG-4 AVC\/H.264MP4: MPEG-4 AVC\/H.264\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAudio recording formatXAVC S: LPCM, 2chAVCHD: Dolby Digital (AC-3), 2ch, Dolby Digital Stereo CreatorMP4: MPEG-4 AAC-LC, 2ch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage size (pixels)NTSC XAVC S 4K: 3840 x 2160 (30p\/100Mbps, 30p\/60Mbps, 24p\/100Mbps, 24p\/60Mbps)\n                            XAVC S HD: 1920 x 1080 (60p\/50Mbps, 30p\/50Mbps, 24p\/50Mbps, 120p\/100Mbps, 120p\/60Mbps)AVCHD: 1920 x 1080 (60p\/28Mbps\/PS, 60i\/24Mbps\/FX, 60i\/17Mbps\/FH, 24p\/24Mbps\/FX, 24p\/17Mbps\/FH)MP4: 1920 x 1080 (60p\/28Mbps, 30p\/16Mbps), 1280 x 720 (30p\/6Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPAL XAVC S 4K: 3840 x 2160 (25p\/100Mbps, 25p\/60Mbps)XAVC S HD: 1920 x 1080 (50p\/50Mbps, 25p\/50Mbps, 100p\/100Mbps, 100p\/60Mbps)AVCHD: 1920 x 1080 (50p\/28Mbps\/PS, 50i\/24Mbps\/FX, 50i\/17Mbps\/FH, 25p\/24Mbps\/FX, 25p\/17Mbps\/FH)MP4: 1920 x 1080 (50p\/28Mbps, 25p\/16Mbps), 1280 x 720 (25p\/6Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh Frame Rate RecordingNTSC 1920 x 1080 (24p\/12Mbps, 30p\/16Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPAL 1920 x 1080 (25p\/16Mbps)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Picture Profile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Yes (Off \/ PP1-PP9) Parameters: Black level, Gamma (Movie, Still, Cine1-4, ITU709, ITU709 800%, S-Log2, S-Log3), Black Gamma, Knee, Color Mode (Movie, Still, Cinema, Pro, ITU709 Matrix, White&Black, S-Gamut, S-Gamut3.Cine, S-Gamut3), Saturation, Color Phase, Color Depth, Detail, Copy, Reset\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMovie functionsAudio Level Display, Audio Rec Level, Auto Slow Shutter, HDMI info.

The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure.
